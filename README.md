# Fourier-Transforms

Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique that transforms a function of time, to a function of frequency.
Types of Fourier Transforms:
  1. Continuous Time Fourier Transform (CTFT)
  2. Continuous Time Fourier Series (CTFS)
  3. Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)
  4. Discrete Time Fourier Series (DTFS)

Fourier Transforms are used in many applications including:
  1. Circuit Analysis
  2. Signal Analysis
  3. Image Processing
  4. Application to Initial boundary value problems (IBVP)

This project looks at some of the implementations of Fourier Transforms in different languages.
